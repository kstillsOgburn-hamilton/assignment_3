BertTokenizer converts the raw text of reviews into a list of numbers (token IDs)
it's a bridge between the raw text dataset and numerical tensors that the model will use


outputs = self.model(**batch) # use this in train.py


for batch in train_dataloader:
    input_ids = batch['input_ids']
    ratings = batch['ratings']   # my key in the train.py
    logits = model(input_ids)
    loss = criterion(logits, ratings)
